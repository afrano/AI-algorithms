AI-algorithms
=============
A selection of well-known AI and machine learning algorithms, implemented in Java. The code is very domain-agnostic, using interfaces wherever possible, so it can be adapted for many tasks.

Currently, the included algorithms are:

Data Mining
------------------------
* Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
* Association rules: apriori

Artificial Neural Networks
------------------------
* Perceptron training using
 * Perceptron rule
 * Delta rule (stochastic gradient descent)

Reinforcement learning
------------------------
* Q-learning, using
 * Boltzmann action selection
 * Ð„-greedy action selection

Graph algorithms
------------------------
* A* search
